# 06 Server Side APIs: WeatherDashboard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard website.  It allows a user to search for weather based on a city location.  It will display current weather details along with a 5 day forecast.  The site also keeps track of historical searches; the user can click on a previously searched city to display the current weather and forecast.  If a new search is done on a city that was previously searched, it will move the city to the top of the list.  The most recent search is always at the top.  Also, it's case insensitive and search for a repeat city with different casing will not matter, the city will still be recognized and moved to the top.
